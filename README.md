# Real-Time Credit Card Fraud Detection using OpenCV & Machine Learning

## 📖 Introduction
This project implements a **fraud detection system** that identifies suspicious/fraudulent transactions using **OpenCV (Computer Vision)** and **Machine Learning algorithms**.  
It is designed to help financial institutions and users detect fraudulent activities in real time.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Real-time fraud detection** using OpenCV  
- ✅ **Machine Learning models** (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)  
- ✅ **Secure & efficient system** to detect fraudulent transactions  
- ✅ **Highly imbalanced dataset handling** (SMOTE / undersampling techniques)  
- ✅ **Graphical analysis & visualization** of fraud vs genuine transactions  
- ✅ **User-friendly results with accuracy comparison**
